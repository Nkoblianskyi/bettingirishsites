                    Betting in Ireland dates back to ancient Celtic times, where wagers were placed on feats of
                    strength, chariot races, and other competitions during festivals and gatherings. The Brehon Laws,
                    Ireland's ancient legal system, even contained provisions for gambling disputes.

                    By the 18th century, horse racing had become firmly established as a national pastime, with the
                    Curragh racecourse in County Kildare hosting races since 1727, making it one of the oldest
                    racecourses in the world.

                    The 20th century saw the rise of Irish bookmaking families like Power, Boylesports, and others who
                    built betting empires from humble beginnings. These local bookmakers became fixtures in Irish towns
                    and villages, creating a uniquely Irish betting culture centered around personal relationships and
                    community.

                  <p className="text-stone-black/80 leading-relaxed">
                    The 1926 Betting Act formalized legal bookmaking in Ireland, creating the regulatory framework that
                    would evolve into today's system. This legislation helped establish Ireland's reputation for fair
                    and well-regulated betting.
